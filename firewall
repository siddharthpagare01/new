 Which is the default zone:
 # firewall-cmd--get-default-zone
 What are the rules for the default zone:
 # firewall-cmd--list-all
 If you want to see the rule for other zones:
 # firewall-cmd--zone=dmz--list-all
 If you want to connect the inetrface to 'dmz' from 'public', then the interface will move from
 'public' to 'dmz' & and 'dmz' will active:
# firewall-cmd--zone=dmz--change-interface=ens33
 # firewall-cmd--zone=dmz--add-interface=ens33
 [will only change for runtime]
 # firewall-cmd--zone=public--list-all [To check]
 # firewall-cmd--zone=dmz--list-all [To check]
 If you reload the firewall and check the 'dmz', interface will set back to 'public' zone, because of
 the 'realtime' changes:
 #firewall-cmd--reload
 #firewall-cmd--zone=dmz--list-all [To check]
 #firewall-cmd--list-all [To check]
 To make it permanent
 #firewall-cmd--zone=dmz--change-interface=ens160--permanent
 #firewall-cmd--reload
 To check all the services to add in 'public' zone:
 # firewall-cmd--get-services
 NOTE: All the services have their individual XML files, are located /usr/lib/firewalld/services
 If you want to deny access of SSH on the machine, so you just need to remove SSH service
 from the public(or current) zone:
 #firewall-cmd--zone=public--remove-service=ssh--permanent
 #firewall-cmd--reload
 #firewall-cmd--zone=public--list-all
 To add any service:
 #firewall-cmd--zone=public--add-service=ssh--permanent
 #firewall-cmd--reload
 #firewall-cmd--zone=public--list-all
 To remove port number:
 #firewall-cmd--zone=public--remove-port=8080/tcp
#firewall-cmd--reload
 #firewall-cmd--zone=public--list-all
 To add port number
 #firewall-cmd--zone=public--add-port=2020/tcp--permanent
 #firewall-cmd--reload
 #firewall-cmd--zone=public--list-al
