Squid is caching and forwarding HTTP web proxy. Which
 is used to speed up a web server by caching repeated
 requests, caching web, DNS and filtering traffic.
 # yum install squid-y
 # apt install squid-y
 # systemctl restart squid
 # systemctl enable squid
 To check:
 ``````````
 # squid-k check | echo $?
Port : 3128
 # firewall-cmd--zone=public--add-service=squid--permanent
 # firewall-cmd--reload
 RULE:
 `````
 http_access: Allows HTTP clients (browsers) to access the
 HTTP port. This is the primary access control list.
 http_reply_access: Allows HTTP clients (browsers) to
 receive the reply to their request. This further restricts
 permissions given by http_access.
# squid-v
 Squid web cach dir: /var/spool/squid
 # vim /etc/squid/squid.conf
 Test the syntax of squid.conf:
 # squid-k parse
 # ls /var/log/squid
 # ls /var/spool/squid
 # systemctl restart squid
 OR
 # systemctl reload squid
 OR
 Wecan reload squid configuration file without restarting
 service:
 # squid-k reconfigure

 [1(a)] : The value of the header X-Cache shows that the
 requested document was not in the Squid cache (MISS) of
 the computer moon.
 [1(b)] : The example above contains two X-Cache lines.
 The second one X-Cache-Lookup is produced by the
 internal caching software of the originating Web server.
 [2] : The value of the header Via shows the HTTP version,
 the name of the computer, and the version of Squid in use.
 X-Forwarded-For Header:
 `````````````````````````
=> If set to "on", squid will append your client's IP address
 in HTTP req it forwards like:
 X-Forwarded-For: 192.1.1.1
 => If set to "off", it will appear as
 X-Forwarded-For: unknown
 => If set to "transparent", Squid will not alter the
 "X-Forwarded-For" header in any way.
 => If set to "delete", Squid will delete the extire
 "X-Forwarded-For" header.
 So modify the entry:
 forwarded_for delete
 ______________
 configure:
 ``````````
 # vim /etc/squid/squid.conf
 # go to end of the file and add those entries
 forwarded_for delete
 via off
# squid-k reconfigur
